# Mojo Advent of Code ðŸ”¥
Solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

I am quite enthusiastic about Mojo, so I decided to start getting some hands-on practice by solving the Advent of Code puzzles.

As I go on solving the exercises, there are new versions of Mojo coming out, I keep on learning new stuff, so there will probably be a noticable learning curve. I may solve the same problem differently for the puzzle of day one than that of day 10 for example.

My first article about Mojo from 2023: [Python vs Mojo ðŸ”¥: First look and speed â€‹comparison](https://rolkotech.blogspot.com/2023/06/python-vs-mojo-first-look-and-speed.html). I suspect more to come.

Starting Mojo version: 24.2.0
Current Mojo version: 24.4.0
